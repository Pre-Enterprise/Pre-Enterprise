# Pre-Enterprise

Pre-Enterprise is a large corporate code base simulation that aims to replicate the challenges faced by developers working in a complex, multi-layered organization. 

As with many corporate code bases, Pre-Enterprise can be messy, outdated, and difficult to navigate. 

However, it also provides an opportunity for developers to hone their skills in working with legacy code, managing dependencies, and collaborating with other teams. 

By simulating the challenges of a real-world corporate environment, Pre-Enterprise helps developers prepare for the complexities of working in a large organization.
